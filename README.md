# spotify_lyrics_fetch.py

spotify_lyrics_fetch is a python script that takes your spotify username as input, fetches your currently playing song from spotify and scrapes genius.com to fetch the lyrics. This script uses the spotipy and bs4 libraries; as of Jan 10, 2019, pip install does not fetch the updated version of spotipy, so it must be installed from github.
